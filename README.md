In this project, an aspiring App Developer needs data-driven insights to decide the type of apps to build. 
The app developer had a few questions.
1. What app categories are most popular?
2. What price should I set? 
3. How can I maximize user ratings?

Recommendations or Data Insights:
1. Paid apps have better ratings.
2. Apps supporting between 10-30 languages have better ratings.
3. Finance & Book apps have low ratings.
4. Apps with longer descriptions have better ratings.
5. New apps should aim for an average rating above 3.5.
6. Games & Entertainment have high competition.
